# Git & GitHub Workshop

Originally created for HackFSU '17, this workshop hopes to introduce new hackers
to the basics of using `git` with GitHub.

# [Feedback](https://github.com/polyhacks17/github-workshop/issues/1)

Please leave feedback if you have participated in this workshop!  It helps me
tweak and improve the future iterations of this workshop, close up any holes
in my instructions, and address any pitfalls involved in using `git` or GitHub.
